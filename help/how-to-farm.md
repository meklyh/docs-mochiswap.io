# üë®‚Äçüåæ How to farm

{% hint style="info" %}
Before you start farming, you need to setup Metamask for the chain you are on. [**HERE**](https://docs.harmony.one/home/network/wallets/browser-extensions-wallets/metamask-wallet) is a guide for setting up Metamask for Harmony. And [**HERE**](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/connecting-metamask-to-binance-smart-chain) ****is a guide for setting up Metamask for BSC.

You can start farming by choosing a pool you like üèä.

Usually pools that have lower APRs have more people in them. If you want to get higher rewards, try choosing a pool that has low liquidity in it and a higher multiplier \(pools sometimes have multipliers on them to incetivize people to farm there - 10x, 5x, etc.\)

* After you have made your choice, use the [**SWAP**](https://one.mochiswap.io/#/swap) part of the Mochiswap DEX and buy whatever tokens you need.
* If you want to stake an LP token, you need to make a Liquidity Pair [**HERE**](https://one.mochiswap.io/#/pool).
* Select one of the farms [**HERE**](https://harmony.mochiswap.io/farms).
* Approve the contract.
* Deposit the amount of LP tokens you want, and **Confirm** the transaction.
* Happy farming!

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you made a LP token and you can't find it in your wallet or in the Pool section of the DEX, don't be scared. Check out the contract addresses [**HERE**](https://info.mochiswap.io/information/contracts) or alternatively look for them in the Analytics page on Mochiswap.
