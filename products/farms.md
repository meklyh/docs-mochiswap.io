# ðŸšœ Farms

Mochiswap offers a wide array of farms. Check all of them out [HERE](https://harmony.mochiswap.io/farms).

The farms used to have multipliers up until recently \(see schedule below\).

### **Bonus schedule**

* Week 1: 25x
* Week 2: 20x
* Week 3: 15x
* Week 4: 12x
* Week 5: 10x
* Week 6: 8x
* Week 7: 6x
* Weeks 8â€“9: 5x
* Weeks 10â€“11: 4x
* Weeks 12â€“13: 3x
* Weeks 14â€“15: 2x
* Week 16 and onward: 1x = 0.85 MOCHI per block

Right now the farms are on a 1x multiplier so that means the selling pressure is reduced. That combined with the hardcap of 100 million tokens for both hMOCHI and bMOCHI means the tokens are a juicy buy.

**Before you start farming, please get yourself accustomed to basic farming notions and understand what the risks and benefits of DeFi are.** [**Impermanent Loss \(IL\)**](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/impermanent-loss-explained) **is one such risk. High APR farms are a benefit.**
