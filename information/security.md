# ðŸ”’ Security

The Mochi team cares a lot about the security of its products. All developments are checked thoroughly before deployement and mistakes that occur \(such as website downtimes\) are quickly fixed.

We are also actively pursuing checks and audits for our smart contracts from various companies. Even though usually these checks don't add too much value, the community values them.

### Multi-sig wallet

Mochiswap's treasury is in a multi-sig wallet \(Gnossis\). In short this means that the Mochi team has to make proposals for moving funds from the treasury and the proposal needs to be signed by 3 out of 3 signers.

You can read more about the Multi-sig feature in our extensive Medium article [**HERE**](https://mochiswap.medium.com/introducing-multi-sig-on-mochiswap-bd5a7af5c278).

### Contract verification

The Mochi team is also trying to get the contracts that are deployed verified. The Harmony team is currently working on finishing the contract validation tool on the [Harmony Explorer](https://explorer.harmony.one/). Once that is done, we will verify all  the contracts.

Our contracts are also posted on our GitHub [**HERE**](https://github.com/mochiswap).

**DISCLAIMER: Even though the Mochi team is doing its best to protect its community by building safe contracts and covering all bases in its deployed projects, nothing is ever 100% bulletproof in crypto. At the moment there haven't been any lost funds on the Harmony blockchain as far as we know. However, other chains \(e.g. Thorchain\) have been exploited and some funds were lost. Please use due dilligence and be careful with your funds at all times.**  


**We will always do our best to protect all of your funds! Funds are SAFU with us.**
